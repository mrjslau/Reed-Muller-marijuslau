# Reed-Muller-marijuslau
Coding Theory course project. Reed-Muller code encoding

## The goal
To develop a Windows Form app with C# that would encode a string of bits, text and an image using Reed-Muller code
and would be able to decode it, fixing as many mistakes as possible if the channel was noisy.

## Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2017/2017 Preview

## Functions of the app:
- Encode a string of bits
- Send it on noisy channel
- Decode a string of bits (Not implemented yet)
- Encode and decode plain text (Not implemented yet)
- Encode and decode small images (Not implemented yet)
